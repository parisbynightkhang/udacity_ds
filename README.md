# Explore hotel prices on Seattle's Airbnb marketplace

### Business Understanding
- Q1. What months or seasons are Seattle hotel room prices on Airbnb typically the cheapest?
- Q2. What is the typical price for a Seattle hotel listed on Airbnb?
- Q3: Given input criteria such as room size, view, or proximity to attractions, what would be the room price?

I wanted to take the opportunity to explore the data and communicate my findings through a blog post, which I hope will be an engaging post that gives readers a better understanding of the questions asked and how a data scientist works.

### Descriptions
There is a notebook containing the source code and in the notebook there is a section explaining the code.

### Installation
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- sklearn
 
There is no additional installation other than the Anaconda distribution of Python and Jupyter notebook.

### Blog Post link
The key findings of the code can be found in the Blog post [here](https://exploreseattle20241017.blogspot.com/2024/10/explore-hotel-prices-on-seattles-airbnb.html)
